### Title
World Database on Protected Areas  

### Description
The World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA) is a joint project between UN Environment and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). It is compiled and managed by the UN Environment World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP-WCMC), in collaboration with governments, non-governmental organisations, academia and industry. The WDPA is the most comprehensive global database of marine and terrestrial protected areas, comprising both spatial data (i.e. boundaries and points) with associated attribute data (i.e. tabular information). It is made available online through Protected Planet (www.protectedplanet.net) where the data is both viewable and downloadable.

### Temporal Range & Frequency
The year associated with each site in the WDPA corresponds to the year it was given its' designation. The earliest sites were established before 1900, however some sites do not have a year associated with their designation. Dataset extends to current year, updated monthly. In this analysis, sites where the year is unknown were aggregated with years 1995 and prior.   

### Spatial Range & Resolution
Global extent. Resolution is variable among sites as a result of different managing/reporting entities. While some sites may provide highly detailed shapefile boundaries, other sites may only report an area and not have GIS capablities.

###  Statistical processing  
Data were processed following guidelines at https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/calculating-protected-area-coverage.  
  
1. Using the monthly release from August 2018, data was filtered to sites with a status of either 'designated', 'inscribed', or 'established' following IUCN definition of a protected area (http://www.biodiversitya-z.org/content/protected-area). UNESCO Man and Biosphere Reserves are excluded by this definition.     
2. For point data, sites with no reported area were excluded. For remaining sites, reported area was used to calculate the radius of a circle with the given area and used to buffer spatial points into polygons. Buffered points and polygons were then combined and spatially aggregated by year for each unique ISO3 code. Due to multiple designations and misreporting of areas, protected areas can frequently overlap in the WDPA. This spatial union accounts for this and prevents double-counting of area.     
3. For each year from 1995 - present, protected area spatial files were combined at the subregional level. A basemap layer of global boundaries for Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ) and terrestrial borders was used to delineate protected areas as either terrestrial or marine (within EEZ) boundaries.  Global figures reflect the composite value of each geographic subregion.
